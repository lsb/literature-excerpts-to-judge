Western physical science has, since Galileo, been formulated in the language of mathematics.[100][101] But whose mathematics? The question is a fundamental one, for, as Aronowitz has observed, "neither logic nor mathematics escapes the 'contamination' of the social."[102] And as feminist thinkers have repeatedly pointed out, in the present culture this contamination is overwhelmingly capitalist, patriarchal and militaristic: "mathematics is portrayed as a woman whose nature desires to be the conquered Other."[103][104] Thus, a liberatory science cannot be complete without a profound revision of the canon of mathematics.[105] As yet no such emancipatory mathematics exists, and we can only speculate upon its eventual content. We can see hints of it in the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory[106]; but this approach is still heavily marked by its origins in the crisis of late-capitalist production relations.[107] Catastrophe theory[108], with its dialectical emphases on smoothness/discontinuity and metamorphosis/unfolding, will indubitably play a major role in the future mathematics; but much theoretical work remains to be done before this approach can become a concrete tool of progressive political praxis.
