Thus, a liberatory science cannot be complete without a profound revision of the canon of mathematics.[105] As yet no such emancipatory mathematics exists, and we can only speculate upon its eventual content. We can see hints of it in the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory[106]; but this approach is still heavily marked by its origins in the crisis of late-capitalist production relations.[107] Catastrophe theory[108], with its dialectical emphases on smoothness/discontinuity and metamorphosis/unfolding, will indubitably play a major role in the future mathematics; but much theoretical work remains to be done before this approach can become a concrete tool of progressive political praxis.
