If one day it happens you find yourself with someone you love
in a cafe at one end of the Pont Mirabeau,
at the zinc bar where white wine stands in upward opening glasses,

and if you commit then, as we did, the error of thinking,
one day all this will only be memory,

learn,
as you stand at this end of the bridge which arcs,
from love, you think, into enduring love,
learn to reach deeper into the sorrows to come - to touch
the almost imaginary bones under the face, to hear under the laughter
the wind crying across the black stones. Kiss the mouth
which tells you, here,
here is the world.
